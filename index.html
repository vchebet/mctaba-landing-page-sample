  <h1>Journey to a full-stack developer</h1>
  <p>

I joined this tech bootcamp to learn practical skills that will help me build real digital solutions.
I want to understand how technology can solve everyday problems.
By week 30, I hope to build a simple but functional web application.
The product should solve a real need and be easy to use.
My target users are students, freelancers, or small businesses.
I want to create something useful, practical, and impactful.The following are what I look foward to achieving;
</p>

            <div class="outcomes">
                <ul class="outcome-list">
                    <li class="outcome-item">Job ready skills</li>
                    <li class="outcome-item">Real projects</li>
                    <li class="outcome-item">Career support</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
<p>My mission is to learn, grow, and build useful technology that solves real problems. I am here with a growth mindset, knowing that challenges are part of the learning process. I am committed to showing up consistently, improving every day, and applying what I learn in practical ways. I believe progress matters more than perfection, and I am open to feedback and continuous learning.
